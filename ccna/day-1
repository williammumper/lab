## What is a network?

- A computer network is a digital telecommunications network which allows nodes to share resources.
- Nodes can be routers (indicated by four arrows, the left and right pointing toward the center and the other arrows pointing up and down). They can be a switch (four arrows, two on the left pointing left and two on the right pointing right). It can be a firewall (a brick wall). It can be a server, or a box with two squares at the top and a small circle at the bottom. It can be a client, which looks like a laptop.
- Servers and client are often referred to as endpoints or end hosts.

## Building a network

Say we have two pcs and we want to build a network. If we were to connect the two together, we would have a network. All it takes to build a network is two computers!

- A client is a device that accesses a service made available by a server. That means a server can be a computer as well.

In the example case of PC1 asking for a jpg from PC2, if PC2 responds and gives a jpg, which makes PC1 the client and PC2 the server.

Another example is my computer connecting to the internet (represented by a cloud) going to the YouTube server.

Say we're connecting the New York and Tokyo branches of a company. We have two PCs in New York and two servers in Tokyo. The two PCs are connected to a switch and the two servers are also connected to their own unique switch. Switches are used to send traffic over a LAN (local area network). The devices connected over a switch can send data to each other, but these are not connected to the internet. Some notes on switches:

- Catalyst switches are what a lot of enterprise companies use to connect their LAN. 
- Switches have many interfaces/ports for end hosts to connect to (usually 24+).

Now that we have our switches set up, we can connect them to the internet using a router. So we use the internet to send data from the New York router to the Tokyo router. 

- ISR routers are common routers. They have way less ports, and are used to provide connectivity between LANs.

Since there are attackers on the internet, we want to use a firewall to protect our services. You can have firewalls placed inside or outside your router setup. 

- ASA550-X and Firepower 2100 are examples of CISCO firewalls.

Firewalls monitor traffic based on configured rules. You explicitly set and monitor what traffic is allowed through your network based on these firewalls.

- Host firewalls are firewalls that exist on your host PC.

# Quiz 1

In order to connect 30 PCs together, your department should buy a switch to connect the PCs.
Correct.

You received a file over Apples AirDrop. The iphone functioned as a server in this transaction.
Correct.

My computer is operating as an end host and as a client while watching this video.
Incorrect - only as a client. Although my computer is an end host, its function is not as one, since both servers and clients are end hosts.
